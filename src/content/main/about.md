# i'm danish. i live in punjab, where i create things for the web.

when i was 12, more often than not, i found myself wanting a console.
although i never got one, my father did bring me a laptop once. the laptop broke 
before i did anything productive with it, but it did hook me to computers.

i loved the weekly computer lab lectures we had back at my school and when covid hit,
i started learning python for real. jee was a huge break for me but since then i just knew
what i wanted to do next. i got myself into computer science and since then i have been building
awesome things.

in my free time, i build lots of web-based projects. i really like the intersection of design and 
development. I love learning new things and am always looking for new cool projects. If you want 
to build something together or just want to connect, feel free to 
[reach out](#contact).
