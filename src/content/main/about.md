# i'm danish. i live in punjab, where i create things for the web.

When I was 12, I really wanted a console. I never got one — but one day, my dad brought home a laptop. It didn’t last long (it broke before I could do much with it), but it pulled me into the world of computers, and I’ve been hooked ever since.

I always looked forward to computer lab sessions at school. When COVID hit, I started learning Python seriously. Preparing for the JEE exam was a big shift, and after that, I knew I wanted to study Computer Science — and more importantly, build cool things with it.

These days, I spend a lot of my free time experimenting with application-based projects. I love working at the intersection of design and development, and I’m always learning something new — whether it’s a framework, tool, or idea.
